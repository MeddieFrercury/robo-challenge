# Sumo

Sumo (相撲) is an ancient Japanese wrestling sport. For centuries,
Japanese martial aritsts practiced this sport and developed advanced tactics
It's time to take it to the 21st century!

You have to build your fighter using a Lego Mindstorms Kit.

## Rules

Since Sumo is an ancient game, there exist several rules. The rules are
enforced by a jury of three.

### Start of the game

The robots will be placed back-to-back inside a circle and you must turn
180 degrees before you are allowed to attack your enemy. On the start sign, you must manually start the program using the buttons on the brick.

### Winning the game

To win the game, your enemy needs to have left the circle with the whole robot
or is not able to fight anymore. You can force him out with full body contact,
or any other technique you can think of. If your robot is not able to fight anymore, 
for example, because it's software crashed, you win.

## Mode

Two robots fight against each other. A game usually takes no longer than two minutes.


### Group Phase

During the group phase you play against every enemy. You earn points for winning
a round:

* Won: 3
* Tie: 1
* Lost: 0

### Final Round

In the final round, you still fight in best of three. The final round works in
KO-mode, so if you lose a round, your robot is out. If you have the most points
from the group phase, you fight against the one with the fewest points.
